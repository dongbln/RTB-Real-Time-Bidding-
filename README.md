# RTB (Real-Time-Bidding)
Real Time Bidding is a technology used to be a machnanism for advertisers to advertise their ads 
and for publishers to sale their section of ads ( mostly in a webpage).
This machnism  mostly acts automatically and serve as a market place for the advertisers and publishers -- similar to a stock exchange.

## How can we build our own RTB platform ?
- Use OpenRTB (e.g., http://rtbkit.org/site/ written in C/C++)
